# 18 NoSQL: Social Network API

## Description

In this challenge, I need to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. 

By using this application, I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database, and also create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list.
